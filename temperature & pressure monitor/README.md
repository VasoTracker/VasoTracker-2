## Key Features

- **Temperature Monitoring:** Accurately reads and displays temperature using a 10k NTC thermistor.
- **Pressure Monitoring:** Reads and displays pressure using flow-through pressure transducers.
- **Data Integration:** Streams data to the VasoTracker 2.0 GUI via the serial port for real-time acquisition and display.

## Build & Operation Guide

The monitor is constructed using readily available Arduino components. At the time of release, the total cost of the components is approximately **£315.66**, with pressure transducers accounting for a significant portion of the expense.

For a detailed list of components, step-by-step build instructions, and operational guidelines, please refer to the [**Temperature & Pressure Monitor User Manual**](https://github.com/VasoTracker/VasoTracker-2/blob/main/temperature%20%26%20pressure%20monitor/VasoTracker%202%20Temperature%20%26%20Pressure%20Monitor%20Manual.pdf).

## Cost-Saving Tip

You can significantly reduce the cost by opting for **disposable inline pressure transducers**, which are available for as low as **£10 each**. This is the approach used by VasoMoto to cut costs.
