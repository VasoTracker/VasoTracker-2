The **VasoTracker 2.0 Pressure Myograph Chamber** is a multi-purpose design, and is ideal for experiments requiring blood vessel diameter measurement. The chamber was designed to sit on a standard microscope stage, but the baseplate was designed for compatibility with [Thorlabs motorized scanning stages](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5360). Angled cannula holders allow vessels to be positioned near the coverglass at the bottom of the chamber for inverted confocal use, and also provide enough clearance to enable confocal imaging with large-diameter CFI60 on upright microscopes. 

We recommend that the custom parts are manufactured in POM-C material by commercial manufacturers (costs will scale with the number of baths ordered).

## Key Features

- **Low-Volume Chamber:** The vessel chamber insert is designed for efficient use of reagents and environmental control, with only ~2 ml of volume.
- **Precision Positioning:** Independent XYZ positioning of both cannulas is enabled by dual pipette holders mounted on miniaturized 3-axis translation stages, ensuring accurate and flexible manipulation of vessels.
- **Precise Vessel Positioning:** The angled cannula design allows for easy vessel positioning near the coverslip, supporting low-working distance objectives on inverted microscopes, as well as water-dipping objectives on upright systems.
- **Durable Materials:** The base can be machined from POM-C, and the chamber insert from acrylic, making it durable and adaptable to various experimental conditions.
- **Magnetic Attachments:** Superfusion plumbing is attached securely with flexible magnetic holders, making it easy to manage and adjust.

## Build & Operation Guide

The monitor is constructed using readily available Arduino components. At the time of release, the total cost of the components is approximately **Â£315.66**, with pressure transducers accounting for a significant portion of the expense.

For a detailed list of components, step-by-step build instructions, and operational guidelines, please refer to the [**Bath Chamber User Manual**](https://github.com/VasoTracker/VasoTracker-2/blob/main/myograph%20bath%202.0/VasoTracker%202%20Bath%20Chamber%20Manual.pdf).

## Cost-Saving Tip

We recommend that the VasoTracker 2.0 Pressure Myograph  is machined out of POM-C (use acryllic for the actual chamber). Commercial CNC-machining costs scale with quantity - the price per unit drastically decreases when you order more than one of each part.
