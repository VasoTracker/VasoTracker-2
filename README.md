**VasoTracker 2.0** is a cost-effective, open-source system designed for measuring and tracking the diameter of isolated, pressurized blood vessels. As an accessible alternative to commercial pressure myograph systems, it costs approximately £13,500—about 25% of the price of typical commercial options.

Whether you’re new to vascular research or looking to optimize your lab's setup, VasoTracker 2.0 offers a modular and customizable solution for assessing blood vessel function.
